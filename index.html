	<h3>What is it?</h3>
	<p>This is an attempt to create 12 apps in 12 months, starting January 1st, 2017. It's about learning new stuff, validating ideas, avoiding over engineering and <em>shipping</em> apps.</p>
	<p>The project was hugely inspired by Pieter Levels (<a href="https://twitter.com/levelsio">@levelsio</a>).</p>

	<h3>Who are you?</h3>
	<p>We are Rinat (<a href="https://twitter.com/rinatkhanov">@rinatkhanov</a>) and Salavat (<a href="https://twitter.com/khanov">@khanov</a>), two brothers, app makers from Russia.</p>
	<p>Follow us on Twitter, it's going to be fun.</p>
